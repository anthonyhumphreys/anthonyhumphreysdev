## Now streaming!

I've decided to join Twitch and do some live coding on a few open source projects which have been left on my back burner for far too long.

During each stream, feel free to post any questions or queries in the chat. I'm hoping to organise some co-streams soon too, so keep an eye out for more news very soon!

You can find me over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mindofah) and you can contact me on Twitter anytime [@aphumphreys](https://twitter.com/aphumphreys)

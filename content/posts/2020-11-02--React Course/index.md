## What to expect

I am working on creating a React course that will walk through building a full stack application, with a React front end. This will be a real world application which you could deploy and use, not just yet another to do app tutorial.

We will look at everything from organising and bootstrapping a project to managing styling, themes, navigation, accessibility, internationalisation, and deployment.

The app will leverage AWS amplify for simplicity but the course will be written in such a way that you will be able to see how to apply your new found knowledge to any stack!

Full details will be available soon. In the meantime, please contact me with any suggestions or things that you would like to see covered in the course!

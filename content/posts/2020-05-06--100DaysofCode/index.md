# 100 Days of Code!

I decided to do a 100 Days of Code challenge. I see this as an opportunity to level up my blog writing skills, and to dabble in some more open source projects than I normally do.

## Plans

I don't have a hard and fast plan of what I'll be working on, more a loose set of objectives:

1. Publish some useful React hooks
2. Write about bootstrapping projects - provide resources and boilerplates to help devs get up and running with new projects with less pain and boilerplate to write.
3. Share some full stack goodies - patterns, boilerplates and ideas for levelling up your full stack game

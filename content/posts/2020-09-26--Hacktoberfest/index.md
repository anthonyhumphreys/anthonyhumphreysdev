# Hacktoberfest

## Live Coding and more!

Each Saturday in October, I'll be hosting a full day event for anyone to drop in for mentorship, pointers and collaboration on any open source work to contribute to Hacktoberfest.

Meet other people in Open Source, learn new things and give back to the community we benefit from every day!

## How to join?
